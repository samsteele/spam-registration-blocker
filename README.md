Simple module to prevent automated customer registration spam.

Heavily inspired by the Hackathon Honeyspam module for Magento 1 -

Package is not under active maintenance and I don't use it anywhere myself, you should probably be using a more grown up recaptcah solution instead. Issues/PR's welcome all the same.
